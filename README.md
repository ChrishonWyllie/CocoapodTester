This app is an in-practice example of some of my Cocoapods:

* [ComposableDataSource](https://github.com/ChrishonWyllie/ComposableDataSource)
  * Encapsulates the usually tedious UICollectionView setup into a neatly packed builder pattern
* [Celestial](https://github.com/ChrishonWyllie/Celestial)
  * Manages in-app caching of images and videos
